Figure 1 provides a general overview of the classes (only the top levels of the hierarchy) and the properties included in the OpenADR ontology. As it can be observed, there are some concepts reused from other well-known ontologies, such as those related to time entities.

Figure 2 shows the set of signals in the event messages in OpenADR.  The purpose of having differnet set of pre-defined signals is to establish a common set of signals and their attributes for the purposes of interoperability. Furthermore specific deployments are free to define their own custom signals beyond what are defined in the table below.
